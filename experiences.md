# Internship

---

## Research Intern at Sony
### Jun 2023 - Sep 2023, Tokyo
During this internship at Creative AI Lab at Sony, I extend my research scope to NLP for cross-modal representation learning. I proposed [BiAug](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01330) to mitigate reporting bias problem in visual-language datasets with bimodal augmentation.

## Research Intern at Microsoft
### Oct 2021 - Jan 2022, Beijing
I proposed [PCL at EMNLP 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12093) that tackles the bias problem in the sentence embeddings during the internship. The codes and models can be found at [https://github.com/qiyuw/PeerCL](https://github.com/qiyuw/PeerCL)

## Research Intern at Microsoft Research Asia
### Apr 2020 - Jun 2021, Beijing
I proposed [TNF at ICLR 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lU5Rs_wCweN) to mitigate the rare word problem in the language pre-training. We use an external memory to store and provide richer information for rare words on the fly.

## Research Intern at Baidu Research
### Oct 2019 - Feb 2020, Beijing
I have contributed to the transportation recommendation systems of Baidu Maps, and worked on community-aware transportation prediction [AAAI 2021 (co-first author)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16107) during the internship.
