# Bio

Hi there! This is Qiyu Wu, an NLP researcher and tech lead at Multimodal NLP team of [Creative AI Lab, Sony](https://sony.github.io/creativeai/).
Previously I received my Ph.D. from The University of Tokyo, advised by [Yoshimasa Tsuruoka](https://www.logos.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tsuruoka/) and supported by [JSPS DC Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html).
I have served as an Area Chair (Action Editor) for the ACL Rolling Review (ARR), supporting conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, and others. I have also acted as a program committee member (reviewer) for several top-tier conferences including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. Additionally, I co-organized the [GenProCC](https://genprocc.github.io/) Workshop at NeurIPS 2025.
**[Here is my CV](/CV.pdf)**.

<!-- I'm supported by [JSPS DC2 Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html) and [JST SPRING Fellowship](https://www.jst.go.jp/jisedai/en/) during my Ph.D. program. -->

## Research Interests
My research focus lies in **Multimodal NLP**, mainly encompassing multimodal LLMs as well as better representing textual semantics, in both monolingual and multilingual contexts.
I have published papers [More](/pubs) at conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICLR, ICML, AAAI, EACL, VLDB, etc.
